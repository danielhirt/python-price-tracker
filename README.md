# python-price-tracker
Python program that tracks prices from Amazon and other retailers, sending emails automatically when prices drop. Utilizes BeautifulSoup to scrape web data. Part of my exploration into Python and it's applications in the space of web and data. 

 SETUP:
 (1) Add desired products to 'URLs" variable.
 (2) Set value to check 'converted_price' against.
 (3) Provide email to send alerts to, along with Google app password to let applications access your email (can be found in gmail account/privacy settings).
 (4) Set frequency to check for price drops - currently checking daily.
